# Stephanie Hutson
## Economics PhD Student at UC San Diego

I am an economics student with anticipated graduation year of 2028. My main discipline is Environmental
Economics, with a particular interest in Energy.

This github page has been used since 2016 when I was a software engineer. Much of my professional work
is proprietary, however if you are here for the Shotput Box Packing algorithm, you will find it among my linked
repositories. This project is no longer being updated.
